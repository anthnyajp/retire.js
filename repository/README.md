Please always run validate before creating a pull request.

## jsrepository-master.json

Lists vulnerable javascript libraries. §§version§§ is a placeholder for a regex capturing versions with numbers + alpha/beta/rc1 etc.

```json

- Must contain:
  - Severity (align with CVE or GHSA if possible)
  - CWE
  - At least one identifier which is either `CVE`, `githubID`, `pr` or `issue` (see file for examples).
- Ranges are the vulnerable ranges.
  - If no lower bound is known, then drop atOrAbove.
  - If no upper bound is known then insert "999.0.0".
